# Setup

By the time you get here, you have added all required secrets and settings to your [settings](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/tree/master/shub/settings) folder, and you've built and started the image. Next, you should navigate to [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1) (localhost) to make sure the registry server is up and running. These sections will
detail setup of your registry, including user roles, teams, and interaction.

 1. [Interact](interact) with your images, an essential step to controlling and using it.
 2. [User Roles](roles) to give you control over who can create and access images.
 3. [Teams](teams) of users can be created to give group level access to image collections.
 4. [Registration](registration) of your registry so others can easily find it.

And don't forget to read about [accounts and credentials](../accounts/credentials) to govern the above.
