# Installation

Installation will consist of the following steps:

 1. [Install host Dependencies](host) including Docker and compose to run the application.
 2. [Configure Settings](settings) to customize your installation.
 3. [Web Server and Storage](server) configuration based on your host needs.
 4. [Containers](containers) are ready to be started!

When you are done with this guide, you will have a running server! You can then move on to the [setup](../setup) guide to better understand how to interact with your fresh Singularity Registry.
